# Question

What are "static assets"? How do you generate static assets in a React project?

# Answer
Static assets are files such as HTML, CSS, and JS files that don't change over time and are supposed to be served by the web server. They will be generated the same no matter who visits the webpage. But static assets are generated in a React project by 'building' out the project with dynamic `.jsx` and converting those files to static `.js` files.
