# Question

What makes a middleware function different from a normal controller?

# Answer
What makes a middleware function different from a normal controller is that middleware functions do not return a response to the client. Whereas controllers are callback functions that parse requests and send responses back. Middleware functions act as the middleman to intercept requests before reaching the controllers who act as the final handlers.
